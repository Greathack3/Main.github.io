        <h2>About-me and Contacts:</h2>
        <p>Here's a more humble version:
<p>
I often go by the names Yusaku or Senku on various platforms, particularly on Discord. 
    I'm 19 years old and currently studying Civil Engineering and Data Technology. I graduated from high school in 2024, 
    where I focused on Science and advanced Mathematics. I've always had a deep curiosity for learning, 
    especially how incredible insights can be drawn from seemingly small bits of information. 
    This passion grew even more as I started watching detective series like *Case Closed* and the BBC's *Sherlock Holmes*.
    While my love for deduction has been a part of me for many years, and I've gradually improved over time, 
    I firmly believe that with the right guidance, anyone can develop these skills. 
    What might seem like magic to some is really just a way of thinking that can be cultivated with practice.</p>     
        <p></p>
            <p>Below are few of the platforms you can find me (more will be added in the future):</p>
