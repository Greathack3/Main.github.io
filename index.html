        <h2>About-me and Contacts:</h2>
        <p> I go by the aliases Yusaku or Senku on various platforms, especially on Discord. I'm a 19-year-old student currently studying Civil
        Engineering and Data Technology. I graduated from high school in 2024 with a focus on Science and advanced-level Mathematics.
        I've always been fascinated with learning and how astounding things can be extrapolated from relatively little data. This interest only
            When I began watching more detective related series, such as case-closed and the famous BBC-Sherlock Holmes series.
        My love for deduction has been ongoing for multiple yeas and I've only gotten an ample better since then, but I believe that with the proper guide,
            Anyone can achieve a level of feat that would seem like magic to some, but in it is just a hardwired mode of thought.</p>

            <p>Below are few of the platforms you can find me (more will be added in the future):</p>
